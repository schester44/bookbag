# Notes

Offline-first note taking app

### TODO

- pressing `control + n` when the editor is focused throws an error
- Search Notes by tags (via search input)
- Tabs (multiple active notes)
- Mobile UI

- Codeblocks (& syntax highlighting)
- style `` (<code>)

- Cloud Sync Integrations (username, password --- add email if u want password resets)
- Collaborative Editing

### Bugs

- Click a TrashedNote, delete it --- its state persists in the Editor until we change the activeNote.
