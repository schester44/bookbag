# Notes (WIP)

Offline-first note taking app

### TODO

- Search Notes by tags (via search input)
- Tabs (multiple active notes)
- view trashed notes in read only mode
- pressing `control + n` when the editor is focused throws an error
- Mobile UI (add notebooks, drag & drop notes, etc.)

- Codeblocks (& syntax highlighting)
- style `` (<code>)

- Cloud Sync Integrations (username, password --- add email if u want password resets)
- Collaborative Editing

TODO:

- create a new note, add a title and some text, hit refresh... the wrong note is selected (should be latest created note but its the one before that)
- Trash - delete/restore buttons are hidden/overflow when the note has a long snippet
- Add note button should be in NotesList column

* load lastOpened note on first load
* untitled empty note on first page load even though another note already exists (create empty note, refresh page... the untitled note that u see is a new note everytime)
